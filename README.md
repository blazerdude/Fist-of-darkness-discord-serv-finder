# Fist-of-darkness-discord-serv-finder

Yooo guys
wht u gotta do is basically download the file
open chrome://extensions/
turn on your developer mode on the right top side
then click load unpacked then load this file
next time u open roblox on the web
u can find 2 buttons
at the blox fruits page
Find ff(Fist of darkness)
Find bb(FInd black beard which is alr spawned)
To understand wht it does is:

I have inputted multiple discord webhooks from different channels of blox fruits then i used replit to code an ai bot to go through messages and then get usernames which are verified on the servers and lets you join them which has the said thing you r looking for.

Please contact me on discord blazerdude#4918 for any bugs

The code has multiple other uses such as finding mirage and etc you can use it as well if you like

THank you!
